1. Introduction -
 Hey Everybody nice to see you here !
I am Sundram Awasthi, DevOps ,openSource euthuisiam.I am going to touch few topics that is helpfull to everyone in there DevOps journey also ,I think the first question arise for everyone before start journey is that why learn  devOps methodology ? because we have many other approch to helpfull in software development processs. 
Lets find the answer together 


2.   Why DevOPs -
In early period for the Software development process we have a methodology called Waterfall model   Waterfall methodology is a basic methodology that is use in software  development and also in different places.


  3.   Waterfall Methodology Phase -
     We have 6 phase in Waterfall Methodology -
  1. REQUIRMENT PHASE -   In Requirment Phase basically people set together and see what are requirment for the product functional and non-functional service that they are developed . 
  2. DESIGINING PHASE -   In designing Phase they are start planning of these thing base on requirment that they are discuss earliar , They assigne task to specific team  they schedule task to happen at a certain time they make sure they have enough resource to perform .
  3. IMPLEMENT PHASE - In implement Phase we are going to start implement the software by use of codeing .
  4. TESTING PHASE - In testing phase phase we gohead and test our software for a specific thing  , test base on requirment , they do integrating testing .
  5. DEPLOTMENT PHASE - In development phase software is given to final end user , where user start to use the software .
  6. MAINTAINANCE PHASE - In maintainance phase we maintain the software , if there is any bug in it .



5. PROBLEM WITH WATERFALL MODEL -
 Problem occurs with waterfall model is that , it is very long process as its work as a linner process because of it take a months to complete the process . Also we have many more approch but these are not give perfect result as compare to devOps .



6. PROBLEM SOLVE BY DEVOPS APPROCH - 
In today we have many different kind of uses and different ceniro where you can't apply waterfall model approch .
So for solveing this problem we use devOps approch that is very efficient and not take lot time  in software developement process .



7. What is DevOPs - 
 We can say that DevOps is basically the way of software development  , and it is set of value and principle , It has a methodologies also it is set of tools .
The  name devOps come from combination of developer and operation , devOps bridge the commnucation gap between the software development and it operation team .
   DEVELOPER -> DEVOPS <- OPERATION 
DevOps allow single team to manage whole application development lifecycle .
DevOps is an  agile relationship between development and it operation .
  PATTERN THAT CONSIST DEV AND OPS  -
 Plan->create->varify->Package->Release->Configure->Monitor
 
In development phase we have 
Plan,create, verify, package.
In operation phase we have -
Release , configure , monitor .


Aim of DevOps
1. Software development lifeCycle
2. Provide feature and fixes
3. Provide Regular update .


Principle of devOps - 
Devops follow the DASA DevOps principle - 
DASA Stand for DevOsp agile skill association .

Its give certain principle to devOps that are - 
 1. Customer Centric Action - 
    short term loop feedback with real customer and end use essential now a day so for satisfying for them , companies must constantly innovate and invest in goods and services that would delight customer to the greatest extend possible 
2 . Create with End in the mind  - 
     Organization must abund in waterfall and process oriented model in which each unit is responsible for specific role and responsibilities and not for the overall images. They must focus on product identifying customer true need and working toword creating product and services that address thoese demand  .
3. End to End responsibility - 
    In devOps envirment team are vertically orgainised so they are fully accountable , unlike inventional organization which designe it soluction to deay and manage .These team are resposible of quality and quantity of service provide to the client .
4. Cross functional autonomus team - 
In product company team completely self contain entire lifecycle .these nessasity state that has a diverse range skill . 
5. Contineous Improvement -
Contineous improvement enhanced the product and services to the costomer .Contineous improvement in devops reduce the waste and optimize the time and give easy delivery .
6. Automate Everything that you  can - 
Automate associate with the goal to redefining how team delivery its deliveries .


DevOps LifeCycle - 
DEvOps lifeCycle is based on five Phase - 
1. Contineous Improvement - 
This phase manifest the planning and codeing the software . The objective of the project is determine  during the planning phase and developer start building the code .
2. Contineous Testing - 
In this phase devloped appliation is ragularly tested for bug .                                     Autonomous testing tools like Junit, Selenuim and some other use .
3. Contineous Integration - 
Contineous integartion is essensial phase of devOps which deal with software development , frequently change are made to source code .
It is practice where developer require to commit their source code more effictively . 
4. Contineous deployment  - 
Contineous deployment phase mean that code immplement correctly and it deploy toall production server .The new code contineous deploy and  configration tools are required to managed it effeectively
Tools use in deployment are  - Chef , puppet , anssible . 
5 . Contineous Monitoring  - 
Contineous monitoring includes all operation aspect , where critical information about the product are analys by drive analytics .
Tools ise in monitoring are  -Nagios , Grafana , Sensu , dataDog , Cloud watch .
DevOPs Tools - 




The devOps lifeCycle has five phase each phase has its own setup tools that devOps aspirant must know .
 Tools are categarise in seven parts -
1. SourceCodeManagement - 
sourcecode management are uto track and modifiy the sourcecode.
Popular tools use in source code management  - Git and GITHUB .
2. Software Built -
Popular tools are - Gradle and Maven .
other tools we can use are -HashiCrop , Apache ant , and Gulp .
3. Testing  -
Popular tools are use in testing are  - Selenium , Junit,Appinum.
4. Integration - 
To integrate the software tools we can  use are -  Jenkins , Bamboo.
5.  CMT and Deployment - 
CMT and deployment are one of the curial stage in devOps -
popular tools we can  use in CMT and Deployment are - Teraform , anssible , puppet ,Chef ,AWSdeployment , codeship .
6. Monitoring - 
Monitoring help to ensure that product work perfectly.
Tools can be use in monitoring are  - Ngios,splunk.
7.Contanerization -
Containerization is define as form of virtulization in which application run in associated user space that are called container .
Tools can be usein Containerization are  -Docker and Kubernetes .


Benefit of DevOsp -
1. assured rapid deployment 
2. Balance working envirmant
3. Drastic improvement 
4. Repetative task is automate 
5. Proactive growth of bussiness 
6. Contineous delivery 
7. Minimum cost higher productivity . 


DevSecOPs - 
Software devlopment with devops will pose a significant delay due to security problem .
So DevsecOps emerged with devOPs  to integrate the manage of security throughout the development process. 
In siple term DevSecOps stand for DEVELOPMENT SECURITY OPERATION . 
Benefit of DevSecOps - 
1.Rapid growth effective Software delivery 
2.Repetable and adoptive process .
3.Automation Compatible with modern deployment .





Conclusion -
Yeah so Concluding  it , As we discuss above DevOPs is a methodology that bridge the gap between development and operation team .It has five phase Improveing, Integrating , Testing , Deployment , monitoring .  In these phase we use various tools that are also categarise into seven part , also there is a benefit of the devOps approch and  we also dicuss above About DevsecOps that is integrate with DevOps and make it more usefull for thw companies . 
That is all about devOps hope you EnJoy ! to read it and also don't forgot to mentioned me . If it is usefull for your DevOps journey .
Thankyou for reading .
